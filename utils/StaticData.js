    title: "Why are UX designers paid so high compare to programmers?",
    desc: `That’s an interesting question. I can charge a lot more when I do UX consulting than when I do development consulting. 
    
    The primary reason for this is that there are far fewer people who are very good at designing and building great user experiences, especially ones you’re willing to pay as a consultant. In my own case, there are even fewer people who are valuable as both a UX consultant and are a top-notch developer. This means what I provide my clients is a lot more valuable — I know what can be done so I’m not just drawing pretty pictures which may or may not be implementable. Which brings up the type of consulting I can charge the most for — redesigns where most of the existing code can’t be changed. Because I understand the code, the architecture, the underlying database schema, etc., all of that is integrated into my thinking and planning from the beginning. It’s not an afterthought, and that means that I save my client a lot of development time implementing the changes. Even though they’re paying me more per hour, the net effect is that they save money overall.`,
